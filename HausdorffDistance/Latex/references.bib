  abstract = {Understanding the neurophysiology of human cognitive development relies
	on methods that enable accurate comparison of structural and functional
	neuroimaging data across brains from people of different ages. A
	fundamental question is whether the substantial brain growth and
	related changes in brain morphology that occur in early childhood
	permit valid comparisons of brain structure and function across ages.
	Here we investigated whether valid comparisons can be made in children
	from ages 4 to 11, and whether there are differences in the use of
	volume-based versus surface-based registration approaches for aligning
	structural landmarks across these ages. Regions corresponding to
	the calcarine sulcus, central sulcus, and Sylvian fissure in both
	the hemispheres were manually labeled on T1-weighted structural magnetic
	resonance images from 31 children ranging in age from 4.2 to 11.2years
	old. Quantitative measures of shape similarity and volumetric-overlap
	of these manually labeled regions were calculated when brains were
	aligned using a 12-parameter affine transform, SPM's nonlinear normalization,
	a diffeomorphic registration (ANTS), and FreeSurfer's surface-based
	registration. Registration error for normalization into a common
	reference framework across participants in this age range was lower
	than commonly used functional imaging resolutions. Surface-based
	registration provided significantly better alignment of cortical
	landmarks than volume-based registration. In addition, registering
	children's brains to a common space does not result in an age-associated
	bias between older and younger children, making it feasible to accurately
	compare structural properties and patterns of brain activation in
	children from ages 4 to 11.},

  abstract = {Surface-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis
	is more sensitive and accurate than volume-based analysis for detecting
	neural activation. However, these advantages are less important in
	practical fMRI experiments with commonly used 1.5-T magnetic resonance
	devices because of the resolution gap between the echo planar imaging
	data and the cortical surface models. We expected high-resolution
	segmented partial brain echo planar imaging (EPI) data to overcome
	this problem, and the activation patterns of the high-resolution
	data could be different from the low-resolution data. For the practical
	applications of surface-based fMRI analysis using segmented EPI techniques,
	the effects of some important factors (e.g., activation patterns,
	registration and local distortions) should be intensively evaluated
	because the results of surface-based fMRI analyses could be influenced
	by them. In this study, we demonstrated the difference between activations
	detected from low-resolution EPI data, which were covering whole
	brain, and high-resolution segmented EPI data covering partial brain
	by volume- and surface-based analysis methods. First, we compared
	the activation maps of low- and high-resolution EPI datasets detected
	by volume- and surface-based analyses, with the spatial patterns
	of activation clusters, and analyzed the distributions of activations
	in occipital lobes. We also analyzed the high-resolution EPI data
	covering motor areas and fusiform gyri of human brain, and presented
	the differences of activations detected by volume- and surface-based
	methods.},

  abstract = {Establishing correspondences across brains for the purposes of comparison
	and group analysis is almost universally done by registering images
	to one another either directly or via a template. However, there
	are many registration algorithms to choose from. A recent evaluation
	of fully automated nonlinear deformation methods applied to brain
	image registration was restricted to volume-based methods. The present
	study is the first that directly compares some of the most accurate
	of these volume registration methods with surface registration methods,
	as well as the first study to compare registrations of whole-head
	and brain-only (de-skulled) images. We used permutation tests to
	compare the overlap or Hausdorff distance performance for more than
	16,000 registrations between 80 manually labeled brain images. We
	compared every combination of volume-based and surface-based labels,
	registration, and evaluation. Our primary findings are the following:
	1. de-skulling aids volume registration methods; 2. custom-made optimal
	average templates improve registration over direct pairwise registration;
	and 3. resampling volume labels on surfaces or converting surface
	labels to volumes introduces distortions that preclude a fair comparison
	between the highest ranking volume and surface registration methods
	using present resampling methods. From the results of this study,
	we recommend constructing a custom template from a limited sample
	drawn from the same or a similar representative population, using
	the same algorithm used for registering brains to the template.},

	translation and rotation with simulate anneal algorithm. The registration
	is often inaccurate due to the location-independent difference of
	two contours. Generalized Hausdorff distance was analyzed to ascertain

	floating image subtracted the excess points is registered to the
	model image. Accurate registration was attained after several iterations.},
