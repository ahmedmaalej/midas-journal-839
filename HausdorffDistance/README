#                   Hausdorff distance with VTK                               #
###############################################################################

This Software provides an implementation of the Hausdorff distance between two
sets of points. Data to compare may be either vtkPointSet or vtkPolyData. A
plugin for Paraview  is also provided.


1) REQUIREMENTS
2) Build the code
3) Use Hausdorff in your code
4) VTKJournal paper
5) LICENCE


1) REQUIREMENTS
--------------

- VTK-5.x
- CMake-2.6 or later
- ParaView-3.10 or later (optional: only if building the ParaView plugin)
- Doxygen (optional)
- Latex (optional, only for the VTKJournal paper compilation)

2) Build the code
-----------------

- Create a destination directory where the binaries are built. It is advised to
create it external to the code tree (eg. "$me > mkdir ~/Softwares/vtkHausdorff" )
- Go into this new directory ("$me > cd ~/Softwares/vtkHausdorff")
- Execute CMake by selecting the code location (ie. where you have the 
  CMakeLists.txt):
     "$me > ccmake ~/Codes/HausdorffDistance/Codes/"
- Choose your options:
   . "BUILD_EXAMPLE" will add an executable target that computes hausdorff
     distance from two VTK files
   . "BUILD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN" will add a paraview plugin target (in that case,
     VTK_DIR should point to the VTK from your ParaView binary tree). The 
     plugin is named "pvHausdorffDistance". Load the libpvHausdorffDistance.so
     in ParaView through the "Tools/Plugin Manager" menu.
   . "BUILD_TESTING" (default is on for the VTKJournal) adds a CTest compliant
     executable, computing hausdorff distances between a smooth sphere and a 
     noisy one.
- execute "$me > make". Binary outputs will be found in 
     "~/Softwares/vtkHausdorff/bin"

3) Use Hausdorff in your code
-----------------------------

Copy the vtkHausdorffDistancePointSetFilter.cxx/h in your code tree, add
#include "vtkHausdorffDistancePointSetFilter.h"
where you want to instantiate the filter. Instantiate as you would with
any other VTK filter (SmartPointer, New,...).

4) VTKJournal paper
-------------------

In the "Latex/" folder, you will find the latex code of the associated 
VTKJournal paper. They may be compiled with pdflatex and bibtex:
$me > pdflatex document.tex
$me > bibtex document
$me > pdflatex document
$me > pdflatex document

for intermediate files suppression, you can use the Makefile:
$me > make clean


To install floatflt.sty (if needed, Ubuntu style) :

   sudo mkdir -p /usr/share/texmf-texlive/tex/latex/floatflt
   cd /usr/share/texmf-texlive/tex/latex/floatflt
   sudo rm -f floatflt.* float*.tex
   sudo wget http://mirror.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/floatflt/floatflt.ins
   sudo wget http://mirror.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/floatflt/floatflt.dtx
   sudo latex floatflt.ins
   sudo texhash /usr/share/texmf-texlive
